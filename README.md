# Blanet Simulation
Here you can find the course code of the simulation we wrote for the course "How to design an alien" at University of Amsterdam. For this project, we choose to design an alien on a planet that orbits a stellar mass black hole in circullar orbit. This planet is called the Blanet and has a companion moon, which orbits the Blanet in elliptical orbits. Blanetary_system.py is the simulation for this system. This file is written with Pygame. So make sure you have Pygame installed before executing the file in terminal or cmd. Make sure you let the simulation run for more than 10 seconds to get useful data from the simulation. You should get someting like this:

The red dot is the Blanet, the black dot the moon. The black hole is not displayed because it is too far away. The blue circle is the initial water level and the blue ellips is the tidal bulge. These two are magnified for visualization. 

We have also customized a predator-prey model to simulate the development of the population of the aliens and their preys. You are welcome to play with the begin conditions in Predator_prey_simulation.py. The actual simulation is in the folder Population_Simulation. For those who are reading our report, here is the recording of the simulation we used in our report:
