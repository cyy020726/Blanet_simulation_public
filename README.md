# Blanet Simulation
Here you can find the course code of the simulation we wrote for the course "How to design an alien" at University of Amsterdam. For this project, we choose to design an alien on a planet that orbits a stellar mass black hole in circullar orbit. This planet is called the Blanet and has a companion moon, which orbits the Blanet in elliptical orbits. Blanetary_system.py is the simulation for this system. This file is written with Pygame. So make sure you have Pygame installed before executing the file in terminal or cmd. Make sure you let the simulation run for more than 10 seconds to get useful data from the simulation. You should get someting like this:
